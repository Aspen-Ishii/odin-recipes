<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Curry Filling:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a pan over medium high heat. Add the 
                garlic and onions and cook until the onions become almost 
                translucent. Add the vegan grounds and cook for one minute. Add 
                the potatoes and carrots and fry for 30 seconds and then pour in
                the water. Cover and reduce to low heat and cook until potatoes
                are almost cooked through. Add the curry roux blocks, ketchup 
                and garam masala and mix to combine. Cook until the curry has 
                thickened (it should be quite thick, but it will also thicken 
                as it cools). Remove from heat and transfer to a glass 
                container. Once cooled, cover and place in the refrigerator to 
                chill.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Hand knead: Add the ingredients into a bowl and mix together. 
                Once a shaggy dough forms, place the dough on to your work 
                surface and knead until the dough starts coming together. Once 
                relatively smooth, add the butter in the middle and knead. Once 
                butter is incorporated, hit the dough on the table and roll 
                upward, until the dough is smooth. Once the dough is  smooth, 
                shape into a ball and then place in a bowl and cover. Let it 
                proof for 30-60 minutes (depending on temperature) or until double 
                in size. To check, poke a hole in the middle of the dough— it 
                should not spring back up quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stand mix: Add all of the ingredients, except butter into your 
                stand mixer bowl. Turn on the stand mixer to setting 2 and knead
                for 1 minute. Increase speed to 4 and knead for 8 minutes. Remove 
                the dough from the hook and press in the butter into the middle. 
                Place it back into the stand mixer bowl and turn on to speed 4 
                and knead for another 5 minutes. Remove from the bowl and then 
                form it into a ball. Cover and let it proof for 30-60 minutes or 
                until double in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bread machine: Add all the ingredients to your bread machine and 
                turn on bread dough setting. Let it run until primary fermentation 
                is done.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flatten the dough to remove air bubbles and then divide into 6 
                equal pieces. Give them a quick knead and then roll them back 
                into balls. Cover and let them rest for about 10 minutes (this 
                allows the gluten to relax). In the meantime, divide the filling 
                into 6 portions about 40-42g each (approx. 2 tbsp). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Take a piece of dough and roll it out into a 10x13 inch oval. Add 
                the filling to the top half and then bring the edge from the lower 
                half of the dough upward to meet the edges of the top half of the 
                dough. Be careful not to let the curry touch the edges or it will 
                not seal properly. Firmly pinch the dough to seal it tightly. 
                One sealed, place it seam side down into a silicon baking mat 
                and cover with a damp tea towel to prevent them from drying. 
                Repeat with remaining pieces.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add panko to a shallow dish. Brush soy milk around the entire 
                piece of dough and then quickly coat in panko. Place it back 
                onto the silicon mat. Cover with a light damp tea towel as you go.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it proof for 15-20 minutes. **Skip this step if you prefer 
                thin & chewy kare pan bread dough and go straight to frying. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 3 cups of oil to a deep pot and heat to 160-170 C (320-338 F).
                 Place 2-3 pieces of the dough into the oil and fry each side 
                 for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown. Place on a wire rack to 
                 allow excess oil to drip off. After each round of frying, use a 
                 metal skimmer to remove excess panko. Repeat with remaining 
                 pieces. Allow them to cool for a few minutes. Serve and enjoy!
