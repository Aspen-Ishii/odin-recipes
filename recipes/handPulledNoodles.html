    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        These Chinese hand-pulled noodles are SUPER chewy and I promise will 
        taste better than ANY store-bought noodles.The noodle is chewy but also 
        soaks up all the flavor, which instantly elevates your dish. Depending 
        on how thick you like your noodles, you can hit them against the 
        countertop till it becomes your desired thickness.

                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups (280 g) of Bread Flour or All Purpose Flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp of Salt </li>
                    <li>2/3 cups (160 g) of Warm Water </li>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Noodles:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a big bowl, add in flour and salt and mix. Pour in warm 
                water, mix with chopstick till flakey. Knead until it forms into 
                a ball, cover, and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                After 10-15 minutes, knead until smooth (around 5-10 minutes); 
                once it is smooth, Roll it out and cut into eight pieces. Roll 
                each piece out. ** you can also use a standmixer to save time **
            </li>
            <li>
                In a bowl, add in ¼ cup of oil. Add in all the pieces and coat 
                with oil. Cover and let it rest for another 1 hour. ** the 
                longer you rest, th easier it is to stretch out **
            </li>
            <li>
                After 1 hour lightly roll out the dough. Make a dent in the 
                middle. Slightly pull on both ends, and hit the dough against 
                the countertop to stretch. Keep hitting until your desire 
                thickness. Break it apart where you made a dent earlier to form 
                into two long pieces of noodle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook the noodle in hot water for 3-4 minutes, drain and enjoy!
            </li>
        </ol>
