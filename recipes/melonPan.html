    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Melonpan is a type of sweet bread that originated in Japan . Nationally, 
        it is a type of bread made by placing sweet biscuit dough (cookie dough)
         on top of a round dough, and is mostly baked with a lattice pattern on 
         the surface, but there are many different types with different 
         appearances and materials</p>

<h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Biscuit Dough:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix room temperature butter and sugar together to make mayonnaise. 
                Add the beaten eggs in 2 or 3 portions and mix well each time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the sifted flour and mix in a cutting motion to combine.
            </li>
            <li>
                Wrap the cookie dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the 
                refrigerator while you make the bread dough.
            </li>
            
    <h4>Bread dough</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place strong flour and dry yeast in a bowl and mix with a whisk.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix the eggs, lukewarm water, sugar, and salt well and pour into
                 the bowl containing the strong flour and dry yeast.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roughly mix with a spatula so that the moisture is distributed 
                throughout the flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn out the rough dough onto the counter and knead it using the
                 entire palm of your hand, stretching the dough out onto the 
                 counter. Knead until the dough stops sticking to your hands and
                  is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add room temperature butter and knead some more. When you 
                stretch the dough so thin that you can see your fingers through 
                it, it's done kneading. *The butter will jump out and be sticky 
                at first, but it will come together as you knead.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll the dough so that it is flat and place it in a bowl with 
                the closed side facing down. Cover with plastic wrap and let 
                rise at 40℃ for about 30 minutes until the dough has doubled in 
                size. *If you do not have an oven with a fermentation function, 
                let the dough rise slowly in a warm room until it doubles in size.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the dough after primary fermentation into 6 equal parts, 
                roll each into a smooth ball, cover with plastic wrap, and let 
                rest at room temperature for 15 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h4>Forming and Baking</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Press the rested dough firmly with your palm to release the gas,
                 then roll it again. Pinch the closed eye firmly with your fingertips to close it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide the cookie dough that has been resting in the 
                refrigerator into 6 equal parts, roll them into balls, wrap them
                 in plastic wrap, and roll them out with a rolling pin. Roll it 
                 out so that it is one size larger than the bread dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover the rolled bread dough with cookie dough and gently shape 
                it with your hands. It's best if you can see the 500 yen 
                coin-sized dough on the back side.
            </li>
            <li>P
                ut granulated sugar (1 to 2 tablespoons) for topping in a bowl 
                and roll the surface of the melon bread dough to coat it with 
                granulated sugar. Once the granulated sugar is firmly attached, 
                use a card or knife to make four incisions in each direction. 
                *If the cut is shallow, the mesh will be slightly meshed, and if
                 it is deep, the cookie dough will crack. Adjust the depth of 
                 the cut according to your preference.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the melon bread dough on a cookie sheet and let it 
                ferment for about 50 minutes at 35℃. When the dough becomes 
                larger, it is a sign that fermentation is complete. The key is 
                to ferment it in a dry state without wrapping it. *Again, if you
                 don't have an oven with a fermentation function, let the dough 
                 rise indoors until it becomes a little larger. Also, please do 
                 not wrap it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 190℃, add the fermented melon bread dough 
                and bake for about 12 minutes. It's done when the surface is 
                golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
